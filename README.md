# Local Weather App

## [Live Demo](https://robo2323.github.io/local-weather)

A simple **React** app that displays the local weather, based off of the address returned from the google [geolocation API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/geolocation/intro) and using weather data from the [Dark Sky API](https://darksky.net/dev). You can also search for any location in the world to see the weather there.

The AJAX calls to the APIs are done using the [*Fetch API*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) and [*Async*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Statements/async_function) / [*Await*](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/await) which are features of the ES2017 standard.
